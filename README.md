3. **Daily Financial Tip Display**
Upon each app launch, a new financial tip is displayed on the dashboard to promote healthy spending habits. Tips include advice on budgeting, avoiding impulse purchases, and maximizing savings.

**Design Considerations**
The application was developed using Kotlin and follows best practices for Android development, including the use of Jetpack libraries such as Room for database management and Lifecycle-aware components for UI updates. Material Design 3 was implemented to ensure a modern and consistent user interface.

**Version Control and GitHub Integratio**n
The project was version-controlled using Git and hosted on GitHub. Branching and commit conventions were maintained throughout development to ensure code quality and traceability.
While GitHub Actions were not configured in the current version, the project is structured to support future integration of continuous integration workflows for automated testing and builds.

**APK Generation and Testing**
The application was built and tested using both Android Studio emulator and physical devices. The final APK was generated using the Gradle build system and tested on mobile to ensure compatibility and usability.
